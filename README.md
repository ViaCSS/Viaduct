## Viaduct CSS

The Viaduct CSS Framework is a scalable, modular codebase, written in Sass (SCSS).

The framework has been written with both OOCSS and BEM in mind, and particularly focuses on the separation of structure and skin within the UI. This is done by not coupling the styling to a certain aesthetic and building a library of utility classes mainly based on both the box model and formatting model to allow for the quick implementation of layout and prototyping.

Viaduct Core CSS Framework is written with the mobile first strategy in mind, and is completely responsive by default. It uses data attributes and name-spacing to apply styling to a specific set of breakpoints, which are completely customisable and allow for applications to scale very easily.
